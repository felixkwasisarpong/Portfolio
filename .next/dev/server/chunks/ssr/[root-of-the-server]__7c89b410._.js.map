I’ve worked on services that process real\n            transactions, integrate with external networks, and operate under\n            regulatory and uptime constraints.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            My approach to engineering is grounded in ownership and clarity. I\n            focus on making system behavior explicit from state transitions\n            and data models to failure modes and recovery paths. I value designs\n            that are easy to reason about, observable in production, and resilient\n            under real-world load.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            While my background is backend-heavy, I care deeply about end-to-end\n            product delivery. I’ve built APIs, internal tools, and full-stack\n            features that connect backend logic with clean, usable interfaces.\n            Good systems aren’t just correct, they’re understandable to the\n            people who build, operate, and rely on them.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            I’m especially interested in systems where correctness matters:\n            payments, distributed workflows, and infrastructure that supports\n            high-confidence decision making. In these environments, reliability\n            isn’t a feature, it’s a baseline. A payment either moves or it does\n            not, and the engineering work is about respecting that constraint\n            while keeping latency predictable and recovery boring.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            Outside of day-to-day development, I enjoy writing and thinking about\n            engineering tradeoffs, how systems fail, how teams scale, and how\n            technical decisions intersect with product and business outcomes.\n            I’m continuously refining how I build software by learning from\n            production incidents, code reviews, and real customer feedback.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </section>\n    </Container>\n  );\n}"],"names":[],"mappings":";;;;;;;AAAA;;;AAEO,MAAM,WAAW;IACtB,OAAO;IACP,aAAa;AACf;AAEe,SAAS;IACtB,qBACE,8OAAC,qIAAS;kBACR,cAAA,8OAAC;YAAQ,WAAU;;8BACjB,8OAAC;oBAAG,WAAU;8BAAwC;;;;;;8BAEtD,8OAAC;oBAAI,WAAU;;sCACb,8OAAC;sCAAE;;;;;;sCAQH,8OAAC;sCAAE;;;;;;sCAQH,8OAAC;sCAAE;;;;;;sCAQH,8OAAC;sCAAE;;;;;;sCASH,8OAAC;sCAAE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAWb"}}]
