My core stack is Java (Spring Boot) and Python (FastAPI) on AWS, with event-driven workflows using Kafka, plus full-stack delivery with Angular/React (TypeScript) when needed.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\nI’ve worked on services operating under uptime and regulatory constraints, including systems processing 1M+ transactions/day and platforms handling 20M+ transactions/month. I’ve improved MTTR by 35%, supported 2–3 deploys/week, and helped maintain predictable performance (p95 ~140ms) through SQL tuning, Redis caching, and strong observability (Prometheus/Grafana).\n\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\nMy approach is grounded in ownership and clarity: explicit data models and state transitions, well-defined failure modes, and recovery paths that are boring in production. I care about end-to-end delivery—APIs, internal tools, and full-stack features that connect backend logic to clean, usable interfaces.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\nI’m open to Backend Engineer / Software Engineer II and Full-Stack Engineer roles (backend-leaning), especially in payments, distributed workflows, and reliability-focused teams.\n          </p>\n\n      \n        </div>\n      </section>\n    </Container>\n  );\n}\n"],"names":[],"mappings":";;;;;;;AAAA;;;AAEO,MAAM,WAAW;IACtB,OAAO;IACP,aAAa;AACf;AAEe,SAAS;IACtB,qBACE,8OAAC,qIAAS;kBACR,cAAA,8OAAC;YAAQ,WAAU;;8BACjB,8OAAC;oBAAG,WAAU;8BAAwC;;;;;;8BAEtD,8OAAC;oBAAI,WAAU;;sCACb,8OAAC;sCAAE;;;;;;sCAIH,8OAAC;sCAAE;;;;;;sCAKH,8OAAC;sCAAE;;;;;;sCAIH,8OAAC;sCAAE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AASb"}}]
